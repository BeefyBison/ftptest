# test_ftp

This is a simple ftp test made to connect to an ftp server, drop in a test file, and list that the file was placed correctly.

## Installation

```bash
gh repo clone BeefyBison/ftptest
```

Or simply download the zip file, unzip it and run the file using a python3 interpreter.


## Usage

The variables at the top of the python file will need to be adjusted to match the environment.
Afterwards:

```bash
python3 test_ftp.py
```
